Commodity Loans toolkit
===

For getting around the FSA's so-called interface for commodities data.

Can read, parse, and clean CSVs data for commodity loan-rates and loan summaries, and be adapted for other purposes. Built on Selenium and Pandas.

Also includes functions to generate LaTeX tables and do some more specific processing.

Currently Linux-only. See examples file for usage.
